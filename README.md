# A Comparative Study on Facial Recognition between Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network Performance



## Abstract
This study compares two types of neural networks, specifically, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Reccurent Neural Network (RNN), in its simplest form to record the attendance of students using face recognition given that there are no pre-existing models and dataset that can be used during the first day of classes. The study shows that both CNN and RNN models provided insufficient accuracy rate in the test results. The study also shows that the RNN model is not feasible and is outperformed by the CNN model. The CNN model provided at most 70\% accuracy rate which is insufficient for attendance checking.
